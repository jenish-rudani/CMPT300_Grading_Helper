We confirmed that our program properly recognises and connects 2 computers through sockets by hostname on a local network, however, the networks we tested on (CSIL and our 2 home networks) blocked the individual messages going through on these ports. As such, we did all of our development and testing on the same machine, using 2 terminals and localhost as the partner computer name (s-talk yourPort localhost partnerPort.) If you try putting in a hostname of a computer that doesn't exist on the network, the program will let you know, as required.
